Answer1 :
    I would use boundary value analysis technique to design the tests.
    E.g.
    If User is older than XX then as per boundary value analysis, I would test following :
      1. User having age XX is unauthorized to use the resource.( Resource returns 403).
      2. User having age XX+1 is authorized to use the resource. (Resouce returns 200).

Answer2 :
Whenever service B responds with Internal Server error with HTTP status code 500, I would expect that Service A maps the error to a meaningful error like Bad Gateway with HTTP status code : 500. Also, validate the proper error message as part of the response.

Answer3 :
I would consider the solution as :
  Test Transfer-Service against a mock of Account-Guard-Service and do not use the real Account-Guard-Service at all as it must be properly tested by its provider.
